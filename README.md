# USING KNN AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO PREDICT FIFA MATCH RESULTS

## Defining the Question
You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below.

A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

## Experimental Design
* Loading the dataset
* Cleaning the dataset
* Performing Exploratory Data Analysis
* Building a Polynomial Regression Model
* Building a Logistic Regression Model
* Recommendations

## Findings
From the two models:

 - Polynomial Regression
 - Logistic regression,

Logisitic regression performs better in term of predicting the outcome of the match. However, more data would be needed in order to better train the model to achieve better accuracies
